============================== Cheetah 2D Engine ===============================

Dependencies:
1. SDL
2. SOIL (for image loading)
3. OpenGL:)


Installing:

LINUX, BSD, etc:
1. Download LuaJIT (http://luajit.org/download.html) and build it (you may use 
   thirdparty sources).
2. Put file luajit into bin/Release/bin/<Your-system>/ directory. Be careful with 
   the architecture.
3. Download SOIL (http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html) and build it (you may use 
   thirdparty sources).
4. Move libSOIL.so into bin/Release/bin/<Your-system>/ directory.
5. Go to the cheetah's root directory and type 'make'.
6. Move bin/Release/libcheetah.so into bin/Release/bin/<Your-system>/ directory.
7. Go to bin/Release and run run_linux.sh

Optionally:
1. Build SDL_mixer if you want sound support.
2. If you want physics - build chipmunk from thirdparty directory - this is the 
   version with ffi. Chipmuk from offitial site DOES NOT WORK! Use Chipmunk from
   thirdparty directory.
Put all *.so to bin/Release/bin/<Your-system>.


Windows:
Building on windows is not supported yet.
