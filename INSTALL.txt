============================== Cheetah 2D Engine ===============================

Dependencies:
1. SDL
2. OpenGL :)

Also if you want to cross-compile engine you will need:
1. OpenGL for Linux x86
2. SDL for x86
3. Linux x86_64 system with multilib support


Building:

LINUX, BSD, etc:
1. Download LuaJIT (http://luajit.org/download.html) and build it (you may use 
   sources from thirdparty directory to build luajit). Unfortunately there is no
   cross-compile rules for thirdparty libraries, you must do it yourself.
2. Put file luajit into bin/Release/bin/<Your-system>/ directory. Be careful with 
   the architecture.
3. Go to the cheetah's root directory and run __./make.sh native release__.
4. Move bin/Release/libcheetah.so into bin/Release/bin/<Your-system>/ directory.
5. Go to bin/Release and run run_linux.sh

Optionally:
1. Build SDL_mixer if you want sound support.
2. If you want physics - build chipmunk from thirdparty directory - this is the 
   version with ffi. Chipmuk from offitial site DOES NOT WORK! Use Chipmunk from
   thirdparty directory.
Put all *.so libraries to bin/Release/bin/<Your-system>.

Where <Your-system> is:
1. On Linux x86_64 platform - linux64
2. On Linux x86 platform - linux32
3. On Windows - win32

Windows:
Building on windows is not supported. Windows version is cross-compiled using gcc, but you may try mingw...

Android:
Building for Android will be in nearest future.
