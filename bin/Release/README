Hello! You downloaded Cheetah 2D Engine - LuaJIT-based engine for 2D games and
applications. This is an experiment of putting OpenGL, SDL and LuaJIT together.

This is very early and unstable engine. API may be changed unexpectedly! But it
is ready to make some cool stuff.

Primary goal of this engine - UNIX platforms. Windows version may be outdated
some times.

You may find much demos in Demos directory. To run a demo on UNIX just type:
./run_linux.sh Demos/....../main.lua
Easy running Demos on Windows is not supported yes. Much Demos may not work -
this is normal. Contact to me if you found a bug: rpg89 (at) post.ru


To create your own application just modify main.lua; to run an application type:
./run_linux.sh
