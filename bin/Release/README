Hello! You downloaded Cheetah 2D Engine - LuaJIT-based engine for 2D games and
applications. This is an experiment of putting OpenGL, SDL and LuaJIT together.

This is very early and unstable engine. API may be changed unexpectedly! But it
is ready to make some cool stuff.

Primary goal of this engine - UNIX platforms. Windows version may be outdated
some times.

You may find much demos in Demos directory. To run a demo on UNIX just type:
./run_linux.sh Demos/....../[main.lua]
You may skip "main.lua".

Easy running Demos on Windows is not supported yet. If you just copy "main.lua" 
and other demo stuff to the root directory - that should work - run them via run_windows.bat. Much Demos may 
not work - this is normal. Contact to me if you found a bug: rpg89 (at) post.ru


To create your own application/game just modify main.lua; to run your 
application type:
./run_linux.sh
Or click twice on this file in your file manager.
If you are on Windows, click twice on run_windows.bat file.
